# tempf - Temporary File Storage Server

**tempf** is a lightweight HTTP server designed for temporary file storage. It allows users to easily upload files via simple `curl` commands. The application includes built-in API key authorization, which lets you control file accessâ€”files can either be publicly accessible or password-protected for secure downloads.

tempf supports setting expiration dates for files, automatically deleting them once their lifespan expires. You can create and organize nested folders, as well as delete files and folders individually or in bulk using patterns with `*` and `?`. Access to file and folder lists can be fully public or restricted based on path patterns, which can be configured through application flags.

## Flags in tempf:

1. **`-path`** (string): Specifies the configuration folder. If left empty, it defaults to the folder where the application is running.
    - Example: `-path /etc/tempf`

2. **`-disable`** (string): Disables specific handlers. Provide a list of handler names separated by commas.
    - Example: `-disable upload,delete`

3. **`-resetkey`** (bool): Resets the API key used for file upload authorization.
    - Example: `-resetkey`

4. **`-maxuploadsize`** (int64): Sets the maximum upload size in bytes. A value of 0 means no limit.
    - Default: 10 MB
    - Example: `-maxuploadsize 20971520` (20 MB)

5. **`-maxmemstore`** (int64): Defines the maximum file size (in bytes) to be stored in memory rather than the database. A value of 0 means the file is never stored in the database.
    - Example: `-maxmemstore 512000` (500 KB)

6. **`-run`** (bool): Starts the server.
    - Example: `-run`

7. **`-allowlist`** (slice): A pattern-based allowlist (using `*` and `?`) to control which files can be listed publicly in the absence of authorization.
    - Example: `-allowlist "*.jpg" -allowlist "docs/*"`

## Example Configuration

```bash
tempf -path /etc/tempf -disable upload,delete -maxuploadsize 20971520 -run
```

## Example: Uploading a File with Expiry and Password using curl

The **tempf** server allows users to upload files using curl. Files can be uploaded with optional parameters such as file expiration time, custom comments, and password protection via the hash parameter.

```bash
curl -v -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>" \
-F "file=@/path/to/file.txt" \
"http://<server_address>/upload/yourfilename?expire=1day&hash=yourpassword&comment=TestFileUpload"
```

### Breakdown of the Command:
- -X POST: Initiates a POST request to upload the file.
- -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>": Adds the API key for authentication. Replace <API_KEY> with the actual key.
- -F "file=@/path/to/file.txt": Specifies the file to be uploaded. The @symbol is used to upload the file located at /path/to/file.txt.
- "http://<server_address>/upload/yourfilename?expire=1day&hash=yourpassword&comment=TestFileUpload": URL where the file will be uploaded. Replace
    - <server_address> with the server address.
    - yourfilename is the name the file will have on the server.
    - expire=1day (or year,month,week,day,hour,minute and second) sets the file to expire after one day. Skip if You don't want use expiration time.
    - hash=yourpassword adds password protection for file download.
    - comment=TestFileUpload adds a comment to the file.

#### Example

```bash
curl -v -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer myapikey123" \
-F "file=@/home/user/test.txt" \
"http://localhost:8080/upload/testfile?expire=1week&hash=securepassword&comment=ImportantUpload"
```


## Methods

### Method: List

The `List` method in the **tempf** server is used to retrieve a list of files and folders that match a specific pattern. It supports wildcard characters (`*` for multiple characters and `?` for a single character) for flexible file and folder matching. Access to the file list is secured by an API key and can be restricted based on path patterns.

#### Endpoint:

GET /list/{path}


#### Authorization:

- The `Authorization` header must contain a valid API key for listing files.
    - Example: `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>`

#### Parameters:

- **`path`**: (required) The folder path or filename to list. Can contain wildcards (`*` and `?`).
    - Example: `/list/john/invoices`
    - Example with wildcards: `/list/john/invoices/*`

- **`include`**: (optional) Filters to include specific file types:
    - `file`: Only include files in the listing.
    - `folder`: Only include folders in the listing.
    - Example: `/list/john/invoices?include=file`

- **`limit`**: (optional) Limits the number of results returned.
    - Example: `/list/john/invoices?limit=10`

#### Example Request:

```bash
curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>" \
"http://<server_address>/list/john/invoices?include=file&limit=10"
```

#### Example Response

```json
[
  {
    "key": "john/invoices/2024/07/invoice1.pdf",
